# GraphQL Dotnet Proof-of-Concept (PoC)
A proof of concept on using GraphQL in .NET Core. This repository consists of a Frontend (Reactjs) and a Backend (.NET Core with GraphQL.NET)

The project showcases how Query, Mutation and Subscription can be carried out in GraphQL. 

### Notes
* For Subscription to work, you need to have a machine/server that supports WebSocket to host to Backend (GraphQL.NET)
  * E.g. Windows 8 and above is required for local Windows machine.
